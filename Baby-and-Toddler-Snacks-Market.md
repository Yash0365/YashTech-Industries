Experts predict a continued increase in demand for clean-label products, but with an even greater emphasis on plant-based and sustainable ingredients.</p><ul> <li><strong>Plant-Based Products:</strong> The rise of plant-based diets among parents is driving a demand for vegan, dairy-free, and meat-free toddler snacks.

The primary drivers of this growth include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Technological Innovations:</strong> Advances in food technology will enable better nutrient retention in snacks while maintaining taste and convenience.</li> <li><strong>Rising Disposable Income:</strong> The growing middle class in Asia-Pacific regions will drive demand, especially in countries like China and India.</li> <li><strong>Social Media Influence:</strong> Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok will continue to influence parents’ purchasing decisions, particularly with the rise of influencer-driven trends promoting healthy eating.</li></ul><p>While the demand for baby and toddler snacks will continue to rise, it will be essential for manufacturers to innovate and meet the growing consumer demand for healthy, sustainable, and personalized snack options.
